   Navigate to the frontend folder and install frontend dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and add the following variables:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   PORT=5000
   ```

   Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your MongoDB connection string, `<your-jwt-secret-key>` with a secure secret key, and `<your-openai-api-key>` with your OpenAI API key.

4. **Run the Backend Server:**

## Technical Implementation: OpenAI Recommendation Model

The OpenAI Recommendation Model is integrated into HealthTrack to provide users with personalized health recommendations. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### 1. Data Collection:

Users log their daily health metrics (e.g., steps, calories, exercise) through the application.

### 2. Data Processing:

The logged data is sent to the backend, where it is processed and formatted into a prompt for the OpenAI API.

### 3. OpenAI API Integration:

The backend sends the formatted prompt to the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4) to generate personalized recommendations.

**Example prompt:**

```text
Fitness Recommendation:
Fitness Plan for Venus Hu:

Day 1: Resistance Training - Burn 200 calories
Day 2: HIIT Workout - Burn 250 calories
Day 3: Yoga - Burn 150 calories
Day 4: Cardio - Burn 300 calories
Day 5: Rest day

Total expected calories burned over 5 days: 900 calories.
```

### 4. Response Handling:

The OpenAI API returns a text-based recommendation, which is displayed to the user on the frontend.

### 5. User Interaction:

Users can view and follow the recommendations to improve their health habits.
